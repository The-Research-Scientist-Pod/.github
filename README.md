> Empowering researchers and developers through interactive visualizations and AI-driven tools.

We're a community of researchers, developers, and enthusiasts working at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and interactive visualization. Our mission is to make complex algorithms and AI concepts more accessible through hands-on, visual learning experiences.

## 🚀 What We're Building

### 🗺️ Pathfinding Visualizations
Interactive implementations of popular pathfinding algorithms:
- **A* Search**: Optimal pathfinding with heuristic guidance
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Shortest path with weighted edges
- **Breadth-First Search**: Level-by-level exploration
- **Depth-First Search**: Deep-dive traversal strategy

### 🎮 Classic Games Reimagined
Modern implementations of timeless games with AI twists:
- **Snake**: With reinforcement learning capabilities
- **Breakout**: Featuring adaptive difficulty
- **Hangman**: Including word frequency analysis
- **Pac-Man**: With ghost AI behavior visualization

### 🤖 Deep Q-Learning Projects
Exploring deep reinforcement learning in classic board games:
- Chess engine with move explanation
- Go playing agent with territory analysis
- Interactive training visualization
- Performance metrics dashboard

### 🔍 Search Algorithm Visualizations
Step-by-step visualization of search strategies:
- **Binary Search**: With time complexity analysis
- **Linear Search**: Showcasing best/worst cases
- **Jump Search**: Block-jumping visualization
- **Exponential Search**: Boundary visualization

## 📢 Get Involved
